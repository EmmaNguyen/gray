## The Story of BlueSkinX

We started in Oct 2019. It's been unexpected, up and down rolling coaster journey, but full of meanings. And now, we are all-in to attack CoViD-19.

## First, we had to communicate science better
Back in 2019, it was still super hard to talk about climate change. The more I try, the more I fell frustrated and powerless. There is a big gap between scientific knowledge and practical experience. People don't understand, so they could not take action.

During a trip to a healthcare competition in Switzerland, I came up with an idea of using health topics to solve a problem. It is a mobile app to quickly reveal your skin issue by three simple steps. Take a picture. Get your early diagnostic. Share your results with friends, family, and insurance.

## We got a grant by Pioneer Community...
With bits of help from friends in Vietnam and Japan to run a scratchy model as a top 1% from a healthcare competition in 2018. And then a web app was available as an MVP two days later. Since then, I moved around Switzerland, France, and Germany to talk to people, test user experience and validate the ideas. Eventually, I was able to connect to a health incubator and talk to a data science team to learn more about their working process.

A few months later, we were nominated by an online accelerator as a Pioneer in the Healthcare track.  Here's our information:

## A key challenge to the healthcare revolution
There was a big barrier to healthcare. It is a privacy-preserving technology for data sharing unless you have to work for insurance or hospital.

It was what happened when I talked to a friend who tried to recruit me as a data scientist for her university in Oregon, the US. Another time when I talked to an innovation department of an insurance company in Switzerland.

A few months, I was lucky to quickly find a solution at the biggest AI research conference in Vancouver, Canada by something called private AI. It allows us to utilize the advancement of predictions, but your data is on your device without sharing it with another third party. Nonetheless, this technology is still in the early stage and supported by big tech companies. I want to open these gates to more companies.

## The unexpected situation with CoViD-19
Late 2019, a new disease called CoViD-19 started to outbreak in China. My home country was quickly impacted one month later. On March 11th, 2020, the WHO officially announced it as a pandemic.

In order to defeat a global health crisis, it is needed a comprehensive approach with testing, tracing, isolating and quarantine. Foremost, it is all about systematic clinical information to accelerate our progress and save more lives.

On March 11th, I launched a site called trackcovid19.tech. Another time, this comes from my deep frustration to communicate with people about the disease at the beginning of the outbreak. The idea here is to share repetitive knowledge and experience through conversations with friends and family.

It is where I put summaries of the WHO, highlights of the world, common Frequent Question Answer based on personal stories in my network. I want to reduce the friction of communicating about CoViD-19 to a public audience. Similar to climate change, help them understand how science works and CoViD-19 topics, then take early actions.

So far, we were able to reach more than 2500 people around the world in 120 countries, mainly from the US. And we hope to expand this community to a broader audience to join the force and find more solutions for CoViD-19.
