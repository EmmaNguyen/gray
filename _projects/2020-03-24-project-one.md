In 2015, I'm supposed to learn Machine Learning in a Singaporean Grad School, but mistakenly checked Privacy and Security. It led to an event that I read a paper called Generative Adversarial Networks faster than an original track, so my dropout a few weeks later.

After 5 years in AI research, I eventually moved to apply technology for Healthcare. Now I am stepping into a situation in which Privacy is the only path to move my startup. It is tough, especially as for someone living with transparency like me.

Nevertheless, I decided to do it in my own way.
