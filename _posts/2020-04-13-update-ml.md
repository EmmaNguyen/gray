Yesterday was fun. I joined[ a hackathon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa5sc1tCTYQ) with around 400 hackers around the world in 24 hours. Got some interesting conversations at a virtual conference. Meet cool people.

My project is [FastReader](https://sites.google.com/view/fastreader/home?read_current=1) - an AI tool to boost productivity by 100x. I use machine learning to train a model to summarize text by AWS. There is a new JupyterLab product called MakerSaga.

A few years ago, I still had to type a bunch of complex commands to launch the Jupyter Notebook. Now everything is so easy with a few clicks. And you can also find Scala notebooks written by Scala, a language specialized for a computing cluster.

I could recall my past painful experience with sleepless night working on AWS server for Jupyter Notebook and sever setup, somewhat make me look more like an ML engineer than a data scientist early 2017.

Accidentally, today someone from the AWS team called me by a contact left in a virtual conference some weeks ago. I asked for one. They gave me 9 suggestions and 4 steps to master all technology. Here I share it with you.
