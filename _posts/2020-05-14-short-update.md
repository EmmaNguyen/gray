**Review what we have learned:**

*   A wide range of symptoms from almost nothing to highly severity. The 3 standards of common symptoms are still fever, dry cough, shortness of breath.
*   Vulnerable population: Senior citizens, people with pre-existing conditions, the obese.
*   General stat:  More harmful to man than woman, less evidence on pregnant women. A rare inflammatory reaction with cardiac toward the young population, under 26s.
*   A person with COVID-19 symptoms can be tested for negative, mild symptoms, at the early stage. It might be the first clue.

**What we learn more: how COVID-19 damages our bodies.**

*   **Blood clots** an entire body which can kill 20-50% of patients.
*   **A failure of function for internal organs** links the blood clots. Some of common observations are severe lung damage, weakened heart muscle and disruption of its rhythms, savage kidneys, loss of sense of taste and smell.

*   **An overreact of an immune system**: Pink, red or purple lesions on skin, especially toes with a burning, itching  and tender sensation seen as manifestation although we have not found a clear mechanism underlying. It is believed as an inflammatory symptom when a body reacts towards a virus.

*   Up to now there are [under 100](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/10/health/coronavirus-mystery-children-symptoms/index.html) cases reported across the US and only three deaths in NY of the young population with skin syndromes.
*   For example, despite showing no symptoms except for a COVID toes, [a case of a 7 year old boy](https://www.kare11.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/rochester-boys-swollen-toes-lead-to-covid-19-diagnosis/89-6d04f80e-e021-4e30-be7f-f5a10548523f) reported in Minnesota was found out with a contraction of COVID-19 in a later stage.
*   Another example is [a 38-year-old man](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/12/health/coronavirus-symptoms-blood-clots-inflammation/index.html) was diagnosed with COVID-19. He shows very light and mild symptoms until one day he can not walk. His legs become numb and cold.
