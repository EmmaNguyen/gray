### 2020 is a phenomenal year.
Covid-19 sweeps out the world. Economy is trembling. The US finally has a new President (Hooray!). And natural disasters such as wildfire, flood, super storms and hurricanes break all historical records about intensity, severity and frequencies. Yes, I am talking about climate change which is ironically known only by daily weather news.

### Next,
It’s obvious to me that the physical environment and personal health has an interconnection. Let’s talk about skin care - one of the most active communities I have ever been. The message is very persistent with three key learning:

* No good product. No bad product. It is about experiential learning.
* True beauty comes from the inside with a strong foundation of personal health.
* Environment matters a lot to sustain a healthy and shinning look.

But building a technology for skin does not sound as easy like that. One of the most critical challenges is privacy. How hard is it? Well, a few days ago I was contacted by a senior medical advisor with specialization in business and law from a medical school. He invited me to attend a webinar of a newly-published review on [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2669-y) in a similar topic.

I was surprised by his outreach until reading a section called social and ethical considerations with four main points to sum up a concept of a trustworthy AI system (Here I am just highlighting privacy.)

* Privacy: Confidentiality, sharing and retention of data through a collection privacy-preserving process with a loop with all stakeholders, e.g. unauthorization access and de-identify. A list by 6 known computation methods such as differential privacy, face blurring, dimensionality reduction, body masking, federated learning and homomorphic encryption (Image)
* Fairness is reviewed by two aspects: dataset bias and model performance.
* Transparency is about interpretation, e.g. prediction, description and relevance.
* Research Ethics is about human protection, independent review and public benefit.

### Opinion

As an AI technologist with a background in privacy and security research, I still find it very difficult to find a good solution to meet a long list of requirements and regulations. The common direction now is solved by business development and traditional methodologies like homomorphic encryption. Federated learning, a new promising technology, is still at the early stage with a risk of reversing models and leaking information. Nonetheless, there is a lot of nuance when talking about privacy issues.

Personally I do agree that we need **a framework** to progressively accelerate innovation in healthcare between all stakeholders. At least, covid-19 is a wake up call for an entire global community about prevention, protection and early treatment, especially at the very first level of awareness, evidence-based communication.
