## Session IV: Treatments & Vaccines - 4:55:00


### Rapid analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Content Using the Function Genomic Platform

*   Structure: What IBM research lab has done in the past several weeks in response to COVID-19.
*   COVID-19 data is rapidly growing and dynamic with two examples about Genome Sequence Data (thousands) and its mutation twice per month. Application must scale to keep pace with automation.
*   This information is used for developing antivirals, vaccines and rapid diagnostic tests.
*   IBM work (Functional Genomics Platform) from Genomes, Genes, Protein Functional Domains. Put it together to automate this process with an API and web browser.
*   A demonstration of IBM tech works: processed 25K viral genomes in days. Open access to researchers.
*   A description of data in the system: Genomes, Genes and Protein in Domains.
*   Link to data: ibm.biz/functional-genomics


### COVID-19 Machine Learning Challenges

*   Automated literature review: NLP on 45K academic paper updated weekly;
*   Forecasting challenge: cases and fatalities in city with countries and policies;
*   Dataset challenge: sharing dataset useful for making decision on aspect of the pandemic; (joining data set is hard)


### Machine Learning Enabled Systems for Delivering Care to Critical Ill Patients

*   Resources drained, pressure and stress, heath work eventually get ill. So, the solution needed to consider complexity and interdependencies.
*   Healthcare is a COMPLEX system. Importantly, it helps us define AI solutions from machine learning models to intelligent care delivery systems. (New structure, processes and pattern for delivering care enabled by ML models)
*   Example of Stanford Hospital. First started with no AI to learn about the process and understand problems. Then an example of a particular problem statement: how can we identify sick patients early before ICU.
*   Understand the current state and barriers -> identify pain points to prioritize by on frequencies and impact in workflow and outcome -> deriving the components for a new system with lessons about a need to have an objective -> Identify a problem which can be solved by machine learning -> Shown an impacted by a vendor -> Visualization.
*   Design a human-centric system by an example of patient’s need with COVID-19


### AI-Assisted Elderly Care for Acute Infection and Chronic Disease

*   How AI can help seniors automatically in life, especially in COVID-19.
*   Studies show that COVID-19 hit elder harder than other age groups.
*   Various reasons put seniors at a higher risk: age, health condition.
*   Question of how to take care of seniors at home, early symptom detection, manage chronic disease management.
*   Solution: AI health with camera depth sensors with four steps.
*   Privacy-preserving data collection.
*   A notice of ethics, privacy and security.


### Identifying COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate with ML

*   How the human immune system responds to vaccines.
*   A description of biological processes with B-cell and T-cells.
*   B-Cell: Linear regression structure features. (Discotope2)
*   T-Cell: DNN sequence features. (MARIA, NetMHCpan4)
*   How these computation tools are used.
*   An update from ShangHai Research group.

### Repurposing Existing Drugs to Fight COVID-19

*   We don’t have enough time (5-10 years normally) for developing new drugs.
*   Fastest way is to repurpose existing drugs already on the market and clinical trials.
*   Advantage pre-existing drugs: know about effectiveness.
*   Apply NLP, protein structure predictions and biophysic to identify drugs.
*   Define working hypothesis by mining literature for therapeutic targets: what, why and what evidence? As a content indexing system that let you drill down into document and individual sense.
*   Once we have a promising target and mechanism of action, find an existing drug that can find and block an active side of the target by using a biological model.
*   Use a biophysic stimulator for docking which can predict a perfect binding.
*   Use a visualization to see which one is effective, then find 6 candidates with a profile.
*   Computational model is OK to have an experimental validation on cells and animals, but not human.
