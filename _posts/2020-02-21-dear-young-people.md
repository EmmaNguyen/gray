Questions
No new cases in China: a message of hope. This virus can be suppressed. It is going to take time.
Climate and festival in the context of Iran: Change the way we celebrate. Change the way people physically socialize. Exceptionally careful. Use social media to keep social connected.
A request update of physical distance measure:
Public health: take the case out of the population; should focus on containment: isolation, quarantine;
All of these measures can not be everything, but a part of the bigger picture.
Fatality rate worldwide
Don’t have specific data of all countries. We could not compare numbers between countries.
Some factors: demography, age. Difficulty of communication: how fatality is unfolded during epidemic and  pandemic.
What we have is just a snapshot. We don’t have precise numbers.
Test and sample:
Adequate testing and amplify testing.
How WHO treat countries:
Regardless of big or small, rich or poor.
Estimation of the whole medical supplies for a need:
Gap of knowledge
Logistic in supply chain in China, Dubai
Current statistics: needs to scale 80-100 times given the current statistics: 1.2M
Issue of political commitment. And priority for medical workers.
Estimation of prediction:
Calculation of death is wrong.
Key assumptions about people get infected: how long, 2-3 weeks.
But should focus on the driving factor.
Should not use death to measure an impact but severity and society.
Vaccine research:
At least 20 vaccines on going.
First trials were started after 60 days when the disease started.
Should be very careful about vaccine candidates.
Production, and scale up. Ubiquitous. Fundraising for Coronavirus
