# Session III: Tracking the Epidemic - 3:01:45

Taiwan’s Use of Data Analytics to Control COVID-19



*   Based on the JAMA paper on 3 Mar 2020.
*   How Taiwan prepares for the next crisis starts with the Communicable Disease Control Act.
*   How Taiwan designed a center command center with three databases: Insurance stockpile systems, Infectious Disease Stat System, and media surveillance.
*   In the first 30 days, how Taiwan recognized the crisis, including boarding people from Wuhan and the command center.
*   Linked dataset for big data analytics between insurance and immigration.
*   Government stockpile: 44M surgical mask, 1.0M N95.
*   Diamond Princess ship story.
*   Mobile app to track inventories for masks.
*   Infrared temperature map.
*   Communication and Politics.
*   Challenge for Taiwan.

Tools for Estimating Unreported Infections of COVID-19



*   Pathengon Genomics and mathematical models
*   Why is undetected infection important? Asymptomatic or subclinical infection, limited testing capacity, restricted criteria for testing.
*   Consequence: spreading without notice, impacted large regions, longer time to elimination.
*   How to estimate: Mass testing, but expensive and time consuming; modeling; viral genomic data.
*   An example of a viral genomic data by time series with Wuhan Data.
*   Lead to Recommendation of face mask use by CDC

Methods for Real Time Mapping of COVID-19 Cases Worldwide



*   Started in late December. It is a challenge to create a visualization (health map) because of a lack of resources.
*   Solved by going to local news and China sources.
*   It needs an army of people to get data, not just by machine learning and web scraping. So people created a network of researchers and professionals for every single case around the globe > A risk and intervention.
*   An example of Baidu data about actions when you have detailed information.
*   An example of crowd source data from Thermia. Data connected to a medical device.
*   Symptom checkers with AI chatbot called Buoy. Other side, collect data to increase local surveillance.
*   Another flu near you to crowdsource data.
*   Another example with CoViD near you. 260 people reported symptoms.
*   Mining for social measure: to understand social distancing impact with collaboration with CDC, e.g. mapping data between policy and impact.

Epidemiological Forecasting Tools for COVID-19



*   Flu background: Influenza and author story with connection with CDC
*   Flu prevalence data: Most target interest of CDC is % influenza like illness started in 1997. Data collected weekly. Why? Based on the severity pyramid.
*   How to forecast a season epidemic:
    *   Choose a type of model: mechanistic vs. statistical;
    *   For stat models, collects lots of data like Google search queries, Wikipedia page hits, thermometer sales, etc.
    *   For stat models, long history of training data to learn predictive relationships.
    *   Either type, should model revisions (backcasting!)
    *   Either type, prob forecasts are key; as are ENSEMBLEs.
*   How to not forecast a pandemic: SEASONAL epidemic
    *   Digital surveillance sensor > erratic model;
    *   Without sensors, ILI decreases.
*   Information about CDC flu forecast challenge about %ILC and hospitalization.
*   CMU effort in data challenge at [https://delphi.cmu.edu/crowdcast/](https://delphi.cmu.edu/crowdcast/)
