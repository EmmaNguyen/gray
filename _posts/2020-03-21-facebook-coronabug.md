This morning, a post in my social learning group was removed from a community. It was a month ago about a topic about “herd transmission” and “mutation” with two referencing links to mainstream media. Now it is no longer seen by any member.

I was wondering what happened, then found out another complaint from another active group in Artificial Intelligence about a new Facebook feature about health topics.
I quickly recognize that it is governed by algorithms, not a human moderator. My reply got a like and an agreement for a starter of the post.
