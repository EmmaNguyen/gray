*   Today,[ General Director of the WHO](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-51982495) sent messages to you about Coronavirus Health Risks. If you get infected, you still need to be hospitalized shown. This is not statement but shown by[ a high proportion](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/health/coronavirus-young-people.html) of a group under 45s. And if they don’t get sick, you could be a cause of a life and death decision of someone around you. Literally, it is what is happening in Italy, where the healthcare system has been overloaded by a rising surge of hospitalization.[ Doctors have chosen lives to save.](https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-italy-doctors-tough-calls-survival/)
*   A month ago, I talked to a young couple traveling from America during an outbreak in Vietnam. To them, CoViD-19 looked normal as a common disease in their country. The death rate seems relatively low. Vietnam unexpectedly becomes attractive because of super affordable living costs with a high quality service. They came to my country to enjoy life, but unfortunately, at the wrong time. But it was super difficult for them to grasp a public health crisis given such a circumstance.
*   I know it is hard to imagine what the world look like with no bar, restaurant and festivals. Or how cities would go completely silent at night and beaches are closed. Or, your house lack of necessities like toilet paper. I ask my mother about the last time there was such a situation. The last memory could only trace back to her childhood during the war before 1975. To those with mental illness, isolation and quarantine could be[ a huge challenge](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/health/coronavirus-millennials-young-adults.html) in daily life.
*   During the first situation in Vietnam, on the other side of the globe, I could find complaining message with ignorance among my network. Some in France wrote about how aggressively Vietnam reacted whereas French health minister on television compared CoViD-19 with common flu by a number of deaths. Why did we cancel all festivals and cultural events and shut down schools for months? And me, a Vietnamese woman keep spamming in friend's inbox about what was happening in Asia, and keep talking about these things all the time in all conference meetings? It was indeed a frustration of the underwhelming public awareness about how the Western poorly responded. Soon later, more mainstream media like TechCrunch along with MIT Tech Review have joined the media force to communicate with the public about CoViD-19.
*   For some people,[ the high prediction of 80%](https://www.businessinsider.com/most-us-coronavirus-deaths-ages-65-older-cdc-report-2020-3) was treated like a reality as an universal truth to make an excuse of doing nothing. Well, if doing nothing means staying at home, it could be a good choice. But here is going outside and enjoying life without caring about consequence and believing everything OK, cross fingers for your hospitalization with any disease.
