## Side story

About one year ago, a friend persuades me to visit HAI in a morning after my office hour of YC on a university campus.

At that moment, I started to write a book about "Augmented Intelligence" with a human-centered design, but could not gather enough primary material. Unfortunately, I could not find anyone to talk.

It is interesting to know that when I continue to write a book, their information come to me with the same topic. Seriously, I have to complete a book after a long delay.

# Session I: Landscape and Framing - Started at 9:57


## Challenges Responding to CoViD-19: Perspective from a Physician and Policy Maker.


## Situation

*   It is difficult to set an alarm for an outbreak. There is a small group of people. The previous example was Ebola.
*   Lack of information about the outbreak in China.
*   First action with containment strategy with travel ban.
*   Lost an opportunity because of a problem with testing of CDC.
*   A summary of the US situation: California, Washington and New York vs. Florida and Texas.


## How to use big data and AI

*   Priority about surrotic testing (blood test, chopstick), e.g. how many people in the community have potentially been infected by CoViD-19 and recovered to make decisions to open up parts of the community.
*   Data with respective to hemisphere.
*   Thermometer to America.


## Global challenges



*   Leadership to put the community to work together.
*   Take what we are learning now to help the weaker public healthcare system like Africa.


## Direction

*   How to unroll shelter-in-place: Need health authority and government with science guidance.
*   How to connect testing and shelter in place.
*   What could policy makers do to help people get accurate information?


## An Academic Medical Center’s Data Science Response to a Pandemic.


## Operation plan

*   How many patients, ICU bed, PPEs?
*   Source of information:  Regional (health departments, census age breakdown) and Institutional (Lab test report, ADT feed, presenting symptoms)
*   What we learn: Growth rate calculation, disease burden estimation.
*   Modeling effort: Test positive rate, admission rate, ICU admission rate.
*   Three different models:
    *   Hospital bed and resources use.
    *   Project county hospitalization.
    *   Estimate case trend and policy impact.


## Clinical care decision

*   Who to be tested, a better screen, co-infection needs more aggressive care.
*   Clinical insight


## There are two different kinds of EMR


*   Epidemic simulation (SEIR)
    *   Impact of policy interventions.
    *   10-12 diverse inputs, which are all guesses at the moment.
    *   Example: Epidemic curve - An example of Open AI
    *   Take away: Despite everyone best’s effort, we don’t have the best accurate input.
*   Simple calculators that tell us in the next few days:
    *   Few inputs: cases, hospitalization, bed capacity.
    *   Hard to get reliable counts of these simple inputs.


## Suggestion: Use hospitalization data:


*   Local region for Healthcare system capacity.
*   There is a 12-14 days lag between intervention and an apex. Notice: day-to-day variation can be misled. A growth rate of 15% could lead to 5x-6x times higher than it is when you intervened.
*   Example: CoViD-19 tool provided [http://surf.stanford.edu/covid-19-tools/](http://surf.stanford.edu/covid-19-tools/)


## Issues in Responsible Reporting of CoViD-19


*   Personal story about a speaker. Focus on containment.
*   Tough decisions about social impact of news with example of Italy. How to keep a balance between informing and alarming.
*   Public health crisis: misinformation, disinformation, spread of false news.
*   Example of some rumours by the Ebola epidemic and Twitter account. Done by an  internet agency.
*   A free press, but journalists are not well-supported.
*   News organizations have no plan for covering epidemics/ pandemics. Lack of health/ science dedicated to writing about this topic.
*   Solutions about information toolkits.


# Global best practices in Controlling the CoViD-19 Pandemic.


## Four responses: South Korea, China, Hong Kong and Singapore.


*   Singapore: Strict containment with strong strict travel restriction, quarantine, temperature screening, rapid tests. 2000 tests/ day. Did not have a lockdown, shelter in place. Unified gov response and transparent communication with daily whats-app messaging, a comic book about quarantine, developed an app called trace contacting.
*   South Korea: Rigours testing. Rapid testing 100k/ day, 600 test centers, 300k at peak. High-surveillance, quarantine and communication. Lack of strict lockdown.
*   China: A bold and aggressive approach. Expand their infrastructure very rapidly: 40,000K to Wuhan and 15K epidemiologists to do contact tracing. Strategy: high tech.
*   Hongkong: Closure of schools, businesses, amusement; wristbands for tracking those in quarantine.


## Common learning


*   Extensive preparation with the 2003 SARS-CoV epidemic.
*   Swift and decisive physical distancing.
*   Rapid testing.
*   Frequent coordination between public and community.


## Other countries


*   Example of Italy: Containment is possible if you test early with a drop 3% -> 0.25% infected.
*   Example of Iran.
*   The US: Lack of testing. State by states health policy.
*   India: Massive lockdown.
*   Taiwan: Big Data Analytics.
*   Best practices and the future:
    *   Human and planetary health: Environment, human and animal health.
    *   Surveillance to detect emerging zoonotic disease in animals and humans.
    *   Evidence-based intervention to build community resilience to prevent, adapt and respond to pandemics.
